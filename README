I. Introduction
===============

This software allows you to set up a "TiVo for Radio" system so you can
record a program off of a radio station's webstream for later listening.
This is intended for personal, non-commercial use only. The software should
be run on private server behind a firewall of some sort and published
podcast streams should not be made available to the whole internet. If you
make copyrighted material available to the world, you assume full
responsibilty for any consequences.

II. Prerequisits
================

This software is built using Perl and several openly available libraries.
In order to run, you must install the following modules (and their
prerequisits) from CPAN.

 o WWW::Curl::Easy
 o XML::RSS
 o MP3::Tag
 o Lingua::EN::NameCase

III. Configuration
==================

Configuration requires at least a little bit of editing on your part. There
is no GUI. You can have a simple configuration that just saves the audio
stream and builds a minimal feed for your podcatcher, or you can have a
more advanced configuration that finds and metadata for an episode and
builds a more rich feed with show tile, description, and/or playlist
information. A simple feed can be found in lib/MyPodcasts/example.

The names you choose for your configuration file are important because they
are the names of the podcast that you will use for invocation and also for
the uri of the RSS feed.

Stream capture and feed building have been separated so that you can
capture a show on Friday and build the feed for it on Monday when the
show's homepage gets updated with show data.

Everything can be set to run automatically via cron so you can set it and
forget it.
